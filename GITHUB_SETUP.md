## Next Steps

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
```bash
# Go to GitHub.com and create a new repository named: tfm-loyalty-prediction
# Don't initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (already exists)
```

### 2. Connect Local Repository to GitHub
```bash
cd /home/adelatorre84/DevProjects/tfm-loyalty-prediction
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tfm-loyalty-prediction.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Verify Upload
- Check that all notebooks are visible
- Verify README.md displays correctly
- Confirm directory structure is preserved

## Important Notes

- **Large files excluded**: Model files (.pkl), raw data (.xlsx), and generated figures
- **Processed data included**: CSV files for reproducibility
- **Notebooks included**: All 8 analysis notebooks
- **Demo app included**: Streamlit application ready to run
